          <li>Enter your HTML notes here</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>In the css document, the period (.) designates a class selector. </li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. </li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword.  </li>
          <li> The style.css file is linked within the head element, the script.js file is linked within the  body element.</li>
          <li>We used Chrome DevTools to demonstrate how console.log works and to confirm that the script tag that we added to index.html properly connected script.js with index.html</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. </li>
