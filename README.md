# Josh's Study Guide for the Bootcamp

## Description

With the bootcamp covering a lot of material fast, I created a study guide that I can reference when going back to previous material. It synthesizes a lot of information into compact parts, thus allowing me to quickly recall information and connect previous material to current material being taught. In creating this study guide, I learned how to build a simple application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.

## Usage

Each section of the study guide contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. AWhen opening the webpage and using the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first (i.e., random selection).
